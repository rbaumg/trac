# Add ''Clone'' ticket action in ticket box and ticket comments.

# The script is added via the tracopt.ticket.clone component.
#
# It uses the following Trac global variables:
#  - from add_script_data in tracopt.ticket.clone: newticket_href, ui
#    (TODO: generalize this, have an href() js utility function)
#  - from add_script_data in trac.web.chrome: form_token
#  - from add_script_data in trac.ticket.web_ui:
#     * old_values: {name: value} for each field of the current ticket
#     * changes: list of objects containing the following properties,
#       {author, date, cnum, comment, comment_history, fields, permanent}
