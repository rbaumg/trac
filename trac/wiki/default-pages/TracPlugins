= Trac plugins

Trac is extensible with [trac:PluginList plugins]. Plugin functionality is based on the [trac:TracDev/ComponentArchitecture component architecture], with special cases described in the [trac:TracDev/PluginDevelopment plugin development] page.

== Plugin discovery

From the user's point of view, a plugin is either a standalone .py file or a package (egg or wheel). Trac looks for plugins in Python's `site-packages` directory, the [TracIni#GlobalConfiguration global shared] `plugins` directory and the [TracEnvironment project environment] `plugins` directory. Components defined in globally-installed plugins must be explicitly enabled in the [[TracIni#components-section| [components] ]] section of the `trac.ini` file. Components defined in the `plugins` directory of the project environment are enabled, unless explicitly disabled in the `[components]` section of the `trac.ini` file.

== Installing a Trac plugin

The instructions below are applicable to a plugin packaged as an egg. Plugins implemented as a single `py` file should be downloaded and copied to the [TracEnvironment project environment] `plugins` directory or the [TracIni#GlobalConfiguration global shared] plugins directory.

=== For a single project

If you have downloaded a source distribution of a plugin, and want to build the `.egg` file:

 * Unpack the source. It should provide `setup.py`.
 * Run:
 {{{#!sh
$ python setup.py bdist_egg
}}}

You should now have an *.egg file. Examine the output of running Python to find where this was created.

Once you have the plugin archive, copy it into the `plugins` directory of the [TracEnvironment project environment]. Also, make sure that the web server has sufficient permissions to read the plugin egg. Then restart the web server. If you are running as a [TracStandalone "tracd" standalone server], restart tracd, ie kill the process and run again.

To uninstall a plugin installed this way, remove the egg from the `plugins` directory and restart the web server.

'''Note''': the Python version that the egg is built with ''must'' match the Python version with which Trac is run. For example, if you are running Trac under Python 2.6, but have upgraded your standalone Python to 2.7, the eggs won't be recognized.

'''Note''': in a multi-project setup, a pool of Python interpreter instances will be dynamically allocated to projects based on need; since plugins occupy a place in Python's module system, the first version of any given plugin to be loaded will be used for all projects. In other words, you cannot use different versions of a single plugin in two projects of a multi-project setup. It may be safer to install plugins for all projects (see below), and then enable them selectively on a project-by-project basis.

=== For all projects

==== With an .egg file

Some plugins, such as [https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/TagsPlugin TracTags], are downloadable as an `.egg` file that can be installed with `easy_install` or `pip`:
{{{#!sh
$ easy_install TracTags
}}}
{{{#!sh
$ pip install TracTags
}}}

If `easy_install` is not on your system, see the [trac:setuptools#Installsetuptools Trac setuptools documentation].

`pip` is included in Python 2.7.9. In earlier versions of Python it can be installed through the package manager of your OS (e.g. `apt-get install python-pip`) or using the [https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html#install-pip get_pip.py]. 

If Trac reports permission errors after installing a zipped egg, and you would rather not bother providing an egg cache directory writable by the web server, you can get around it by simply unzipping the egg. Just pass `--always-unzip` to `easy_install`:
{{{#!sh
$ easy_install --always-unzip TracTags
}}}
You should end up with a directory having the same name as the zipped egg, complete with `.egg` extension, and containing its uncompressed contents.

Trac also searches for plugins installed in the shared plugins directory, see TracIni#GlobalConfiguration. This is a convenient way to share the installation of plugins across several, but not all, environments.

==== From source

`easy_install` and `pip` make installing from source a snap. Just give it the URL to either a repository or a tarball/zip of the source:
{{{#!sh
$ easy_install https://trac-hacks.org/svn/tagsplugin/trunk
}}}
{{{#!sh
$ pip install svn+https://trac-hacks.org/svn/tagsplugin/trunk
}}}
When installing from a repository using `pip`, be sure to use the repository type in the protocol. For example, `svn+https` for Subversion and `git+https` for Git.

==== Enabling the plugin

Unlike plugins installed per environment, you'll have to explicitly enable globally installed plugins via [TracIni trac.ini]. This also applies to plugins installed in the shared plugins directory, ie the path specified in the [TracIni#inherit-plugins_dir-option "[inherit] plugins_dir"] configuration option. 

This is done in the [TracIni#components-section "[components]"] section of the configuration file `trac.ini`. For example:
{{{#!ini
[components]
tractags.* = enabled
}}}

The name of the option is the Python package of the plugin. This should be specified in the documentation of the plugin, but can also be easily discovered by looking at the source: look for a top-level directory that contains a file named `__init__.py`.

After installing the plugin, you must restart your web server.

==== Upgrading the environment

Some plugins may require an environment upgrade. This will typically be necessary for plugins that implement `IEnvironmentSetupParticipant`. Common reasons for requiring an environment upgrade are to add tables to the database or add configuration parameters to trac.ini. A notification will be displayed when accessing Trac for the first time after installing a plugin and restarting the web server. To upgrade the environment, run the command:

{{{#!sh
$ trac-admin /path/to/env upgrade
}}}

A database backup will be made before upgrading the environment, unless the `--no-backup` option is specified. For more information, refer to the documentation output by `trac-admin /path/to/env help upgrade`.

==== Redeploying static resources

If you [TracInstall#MappingStaticResources mapped static resources] so they are served by the web server, and the plugin contains static resources (CSS, !JavaScript and image files), the resources will need to be deployed to the location on the filesystem that is served by the web server.

Execute the `deploy` command, as was done during install and [TracUpgrade#a5.Refreshstaticresources upgrade]:

{{{#!sh
$ trac-admin /path/to/env deploy /deploy/path
}}}

After executing the command, you must restart your web server.

{{{#!div style="border: 1pt dotted; margin: 1em"
**Note:** Some web browsers (IE, Opera) cache CSS and Javascript files, so you should instruct your users to manually erase the contents of their browser's cache. A forced refreshed (SHIFT + <F5>) should be enough.
{{{#!comment
Remove above note once #9936 is fixed.
}}}
}}}

==== Upgrading a Plugin

Normally, upgrading a plugin is simply a matter of repeating the install process. You may want to [#Uninstalling uninstall] old versions of the plugin.

The `pip install` command has an `--upgrade (-U)` switch that will uninstall the old version and install the new version. The command can have some unintended side-effects though, because it will also upgrade the plugin dependencies. For example, if `Trac` is listed as a dependency of the plugin in `setup.py`, the latest version of Trac will be downloaded and installed. This may not be what you want if you are running an older version of Trac because not all your plugins are compatible with the latest version of Trac, or you simply haven't done the appropriate planning for upgrading Trac. Uninstalling and then installing the plugin can be a safer option:
{{{#!sh
$ pip uninstall <pluginname>
$ pip install <pluginname>
}}}

Alternatively you can use a [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files requirements file] and pin the versions of the packages that you don't want to implicitly upgrade. 

==== Uninstalling

`pip` makes it easy to uninstall a plugin:
{{{#!sh
$ pip uninstall <pluginname>
}}}

The `pip uninstall` command can be used even if the plugin was installed using `easy_install` or `python setup.py install`.

Neither `easy_install` nor `python setup.py` have an uninstall feature. However, it is usually trivial to remove a globally installed egg and reference:

 1. Do `easy_install -m <plugin name>` to remove references from `$PYTHONLIB/site-packages/easy-install.pth` when the plugin is installed by setuptools.
 1. Delete executables from `/usr/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, or `C:\\Python*\Scripts`. To find what executables are involved, refer to the `[console-script]` section of `setup.py`.
 1. Delete the .egg file or folder from where it's installed, usually inside `$PYTHONLIB/site-packages/`.
 1. Restart the web server.

If you are uncertain about the location of the egg file, you can try to locate it by replacing `myplugin` with whatever namespace the plugin uses (as used when enabling the plugin):
{{{#!pycon
>>> import myplugin
>>> print myplugin.__file__
/opt/local/python24/lib/site-packages/myplugin-0.4.2-py2.4.egg/myplugin/__init__.pyc
}}}

== Setting up the plugin cache

Some plugins will need to be extracted by the Python egg's runtime. See [wiki:TracInstall#egg-cache] for information on setting up the egg cache.

== Web-based plugin administration

The !WebAdmin interface offers limited support for plugin configuration to users with `TRAC_ADMIN` permission:

* enabling and disabling installed plugins
* installing plugins by uploading them as eggs

If you wish to disable the second function for security reasons, add the following to your `trac.ini` file:
{{{#!ini
[components]
trac.admin.web_ui.PluginAdminPanel = disabled
}}}
This disables the whole panel, so the first function will no longer be available either.

== Troubleshooting

=== Is setuptools properly installed?

Try this from the command line:
{{{#!sh
$ python -c "import pkg_resources"
}}}

If you get '''no output''', setuptools '''is''' installed. Otherwise, you'll need to install it before plugins will work in Trac.

=== Did you get the correct version of the Python egg?

Python eggs have the Python version encoded in their filename. For example, `MyPlugin-1.0-py2.5.egg` is an egg for Python 2.5, and will '''not''' be loaded if you're running a different Python version (such as 2.4 or 2.6).

Also, verify that the egg file you downloaded is indeed a .zip archive. If you downloaded it from a Trac site, chances are you downloaded the HTML preview page instead.

=== Is the plugin enabled?

If you install a plugin globally, ie ''not'' inside the `plugins` directory of the Trac project environment, you must explicitly enable it in [TracIni trac.ini]. Make sure that:

 * you actually added the necessary line(s) to the `[components]` section.
 * the package/module names are correct and do not contain typos.
 * the value is "enabled", not "enable" or "Enable".
 * the section name is "components", not "component".

=== Check the permissions on the .egg file

Trac must be able to read the .egg file. 

=== Check the log files

Enable [TracLogging logging] and set the log level to `DEBUG`, then watch the log file for messages about loading plugins.

=== Verify you have the proper permissions

Some plugins require you have special permissions in order to use them. !WebAdmin, for example, requires the user to have `TRAC_ADMIN` permissions for it to show up on the navigation bar.

=== Is the wrong version of the plugin loading?

If you put your plugins inside the `plugins` directories, and certainly if you have more than one project, you need to make sure that the correct version of the plugin is loading. Here are some basic rules:

 * Only one version of the plugin can be loaded for each running Trac server, ie each Python process. The Python namespaces and module list will be shared, and it cannot handle duplicates. Whether a plugin is `enabled` or `disabled` makes no difference.
 * A globally installed plugin (typically `setup.py install`) will override any version in the global or project plugins directories. A plugin from the global plugins directory will be located ''before'' any project plugins directory.
 * If your Trac server hosts more than one project (as with `TRAC_ENV_PARENT_DIR` setups), having two versions of a plugin in two different projects will give unpredicatable results. Only one of them will load, and the one loaded will be shared by both projects. Trac will load the first plugin found, usually from the project that receives the first request.
 * Having more than one version listed inside Python site-packages is fine, ie installed with `setup.py install`, because setuptools will make sure you get the version installed most recently. However, don't store more than one version inside a global or project plugins directory: neither the version number nor the installed date will matter at all. There is no way to determine which one will be located first when Trac searches the directory for plugins.

=== If all of the above failed

Okay, so the logs don't mention plugins, the egg is readable, the Python version is correct, ''and'' the egg has been installed globally (and is enabled in trac.ini)... and it ''still'' doesn't work or give any error messages or any other indication as to why. Hop on the [trac:IrcChannel IrcChannel] or [trac:MailingList] and ask away!
