    This is a sample action controller illustrating how to create
    additional ''operations''.

    Add the `vote` operation to a workflow action, for example:
    {{{#!ini
    vote = new -> new
    vote.operations = vote
    }}}

    Don't forget to add `VoteOperation` to the `workflow` option
    in the `[ticket]` section of TracIni. When added to the default
    value of `workflow`, the line will look like this:
    {{{#!ini
    workflow = ConfigurableTicketWorkflow,VoteOperation
