== DONE ==

=== Category Branch ===

The TicketTypes feature was integrated in the trunk in r1691. 


== TODO ==

=== InterTrac Branch ===

Turned out to lead to a big refactoring of the Wiki engine, 
waiting for completion...

This will separate the parsing logic and the formatting logic,
as well as introducing pluggable parsers and wiki links.


=== XRef Branch ===

Functional as it is, but not perfect:
 * badly out-of-sync...
 * should introduce a {{{time}}} field in the {{{xref}}} table,
   for being able to present the cross-references by time
 * will greatly benefit from the InterTrac wiki refactoring
   (dedicated XRefFormatter)


=== Trac Object Branch ===

Depends on the XRef branch...


=== Anydiff Branch ===

 * The link syntax described in #199 will be done
   using an IWikiLinkProvider (depends on InterTrac branch).
