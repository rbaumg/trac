trac (0.10.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This release has a new system-wide configuration path, under /etc/trac/

  If your installation uses /usr/share/trac/conf/trac.ini, you have to
  manually move the file to /etc/trac/trac.ini to take effect, or otherwise
  your system-wide configuration will stop working.
