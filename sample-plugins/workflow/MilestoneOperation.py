    Example:
    {{{#!ini

    resolve.operations = set_resolution,set_milestone
    resolve.milestone = invalid,wontfix,duplicate,worksforme -> rejected
    }}}

    When setting resolution to `duplicate` the milestone will
    automatically change to `rejected`. If user changes milestone
    manually when resolving the ticket, this workflow operation has
    ''no effect''.

    Don't forget to add `MilestoneOperation` to the `workflow` option
    in the `[ticket]` section of TracIni. When added to the default
    value of `workflow`, the line will look like this:
    {{{#!ini
