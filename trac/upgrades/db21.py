==== Upgrade Notice ====

The ticket Workflow is now configurable.

Your environment has been upgraded, but configured to use the original
workflow. It is recommended that you look at changing this configuration
to use basic-workflow.

Read TracWorkflow for more information
(don't forget to 'wiki upgrade' as well)
