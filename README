== TODO ==

=== Category Branch ===

It's in trunk, except for source:trunk/contrib/sourceforge2trac.py


=== InterTrac Branch ===

Turned out to lead to a big refactoring of the Wiki engine, 
waiting for completion...

This will separate the parsing logic and the formatting logic,
as well as introducing pluggable parsers and wiki links.


=== XRef Branch ===

Functional as it is, but not perfect:
 * badly out-of-sync...
 * should introduce a {{{time}}} field in the {{{xref}}} table,
   for being able to present the cross-references by time
 * will greatly benefit from the InterTrac wiki refactoring
   (dedicated XRefFormatter)


=== Trac Object Branch ===

Depends on the XRef branch...


=== Anydiff Branch ===

This is a little side work, initially thought to be done
as patches and then ported on the trunk, as I did for the
revision log enhancements, but it's more convenient to polish it 
on a branch first, mainly because I'm still undecided if 
it's worth keeping a separate  Diff.py/diff.cs or if I merge
everything back in Changeset.py/changeset.cs
