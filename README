== TODO ==

=== TracCrossReferences Branch ===
 
 * Finish to add the Cross-references navigation link everywhere
 * Finish to add the management of cross-references on Changeset, 
   Report and Milestone
 * Redo the update of cross-references after a facet change
   in a slightly smarter way:
   only change author/time of cross-references if __those__ 
   cross-references have changed inside the facet (decide by using
   the context)
 * Get #787 done, and also manage cross-references on the attachment
   description facets
 * Implement the `<<...>>` syntax
 * Implement the ![[Relation]] macros and related
 * Find a model for storing facets in the db, e.g: 
   {{{
#!sql
CREATE TABLE facet (
  type    text,
  id      text, 
  name    text,
  value   text
)
   }}}
 * Use a kind of model description table:
   {{{
#!sql
CREATE TABLE model (
  type    text,
  facet   text,
  kind    text
)
   }}}

=== Trac Object Branch ===

 * Based on the (old) TracCrossReferences branch
 * badly out of sync... but has still some interesting bits

----

   {{{
   CREATE TABLE xref (
         src_type        text,   -- source type
         src_id          text,   -- source id
         facet           text,   -- where the relation was defined
         context         text,   -- (excerpt of the context of definition)
         time            integer,-- when the relation was defined

         relation        text,   -- optional relation

         dest_type       text,   -- destination type
         dest_id         text,   -- destination id
   );
   }}}
